# The_coffee_shop_project
## 📘 Overview

This is a Python-based domain modeling project that simulates a Coffee Shop environment using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system models customers, coffee types, and their respective orders, capturing real-world relationships and business logic.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Practice class creation and object instantiation.
- Understand one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in OOP.
- Implement class methods, instance methods, and properties with validation.
- Apply concepts like aggregation, association, and data encapsulation.
- Write testable and maintainable code using `pytest`.
